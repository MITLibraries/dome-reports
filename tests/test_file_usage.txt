The tests/ subdirectory can contain SQLite databases 
with a .db extension but these will be ignored by Git.
Do not add databases with other extensions.

Test data files *.tsv and *.csv will likewise be ignored.
Do not add temporary data files with other extensions
unless they are located in the tmp/ directory.

Database schema and query files can be placed here and
will be managed by Git.
